## Origin of data

We rely on the Albemarle homes data prepared by UVA Library StatLab. Learn more about the package: https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/. 

## Dependencies / How to Install

You need the most current version of R, and three packages: dplyr, readr, and knitr.  It is less critical that RStudio is updated to the latest package. [Installing and updating instructions for R are here](https://jennhuck.github.io/workshops/install_update_R.html). 

See the install.R file for R code to install the three packages needed.

## Project goals and description 

This workshop will teach you the basics of dplyr.  The [answers](https://jennhuck.github.io/workshops/dplyr_answers.html) to the workshop exercises are available.
